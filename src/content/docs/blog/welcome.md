Welcome to the RiSE MSR blog!

Research in Software Engineering at Microsoft Research
([RiSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-software-engineering-rise/))
is group of researchers and engineers focused on the systems and foundations of
programming through open-ended fundamental research in formal methods,
high-performance computing, programming languages, and software engineering.

This blog is a place for us to share our research, thoughts, and ideas with the
broader community, in a more informal format than our research papers and
official communications.
